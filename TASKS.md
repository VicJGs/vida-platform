## 🧭 Next session

**✅ FOUNDATION-REALIGNMENT CAMPAIGN COMPLETE (2026-07-25) — all three parts' exit gates accepted; merged to main.**
Part 1 (docs realignment, 34/34 aligned) + Part 2 (repo structure, ADR-018) + Part 3 (roadmap resequence, ADR-019) are
done. The platform's docs + structure + roadmap are now mutually coherent, derived from ADRs 001–019.

**NEXT = begin building — Phase M1.0 (Boot & Connective Base).** The whole foundation-realignment campaign AND the
Linear projectize are done: Linear now mirrors the M1→M4 roadmap (M1.0 = 30 issues · M1.4/M2/M3/M4 skeletons up ·
old ①–⑤ emptied). The first buildable work is the M1.0 boot base (per `docs/roadmap.md` M1.0 + the M1.0 Linear
Project). Switch to a **code** profile/scenario for that (this campaign ran under Project Foundation).

**Standing follow-ons (create-at-gate, not tasks yet):** net-new module/integration/venue Linear issues are created as
each M-phase begins. **Manual:** archive the 5 empty ①–⑤ Linear Projects in the Linear UI (tracker can't delete Projects).

**Git:** `main` is ~60 commits ahead of `origin/main` — unpushed (push on request).

**FIRST ACTION next session — Part 2.0 planning (its own gate-1):**
Part 2 is FORWARD-DECLARED, not yet detailed — it earns its own gate-1 plan before execution (per the master-plan
umbrella framing). Derive the target repo structure from the now-realigned docs: package boundaries; `core/src` homes
for the 5 substrates (sessions/spaces/capability/measurability/economy); `schema/` organization; a disposition ledger
(keep/migrate/quarantine/delete) for every censused file/dir; execute the reorg (quarantine legacy → `Old/_legacy`,
stand up the correctly-shaped skeleton, unwire the v1 `schema.ts` monolith). **Structure only — no feature code.**
Likely **ADR-018** (retire Phase-0 architecture; re-derive from docs). Full double-gate per unit + exit gate.

**The Part-1/Part-2 boundary is now LIVE:** Part 1 deliberately deferred every code/directory-home call
(`[DEFERRED — Part 2]`) — Part 2 is where those homes get decided. The realigned docs cite conceptual owners (ADRs);
Part 2 places them.

**Read first on resume:** `realignment-master-plan/_index.md` (Part-2 forward-declaration + the umbrella framing)
+ the `current-state-baseline/baseline.md` (the file census Part 2's disposition ledger works from) + `ADR-016`
(storage rebuild — the `schema.ts` monolith unwire) + `ADR-017` (features-first, what Part 3 sequences).

**Deferred open Qs (still open):** "RP" abbreviation (Part 3.0, non-blocking); V1/ADR-007 saved-views dedicated
reframe pass; the noted gamification stale-half-line was fixed this session (no longer open).

**Reusable patterns locked across the campaign** (full per-unit detail in the session-log; kept here as the Part-2 toolkit):
- **Per-unit LITE loop:** ground → read ALL 5 aspects to refine the sweep's single-aspect verdict → **grep the live schema floor FIRST** → persist a PLAN → independent adversarial critique → fix → approve → implement → grep-verify.
- **Two critiques for big work:** a PLAN critique (can't catch execution drift) AND a POST-IMPLEMENTATION critique on the prose (catches stale mechanisms surviving as ordinary English).
- **R6 has two shapes:** recovered-domain (no As-is floor, e.g. health/core) vs live-schema (real floor → two-tier retire, e.g. habits/projects/finance) — grep the schema to tell which.
- **Substrate reframes:** X*/AI* ingest layering · M1/M2 measured framing · S1 sessions reframe · E9 god-table split · pure-gap net-new token-naming.
- **The gate's own lesson (this session):** a sweep "aligned/gap" label scores the *token surface* — a context that is *silent* (names no retired token) can still fail applicable predicates ("aligned by omission"). The whole-corpus exit gate + sibling-doc cross-check is what catches it. Check verdicts against *applicability* (framework §4), not just anti-signal presence.

## 📋 Planned

| Task | Profile | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Storage rebuild — from zero** (v1 schema ~60% stale → author v2 from scratch; `ADR-016` + `storage-build-plan.md` ledger + per-table gating. DB-1/LIF-61 ✅ done.) | Generic Coding Session | ⏸ **PARKED by ADR-017** — sequencing inverted to features-first; schema now authored per-feature, not full-schema-first. Resurfaces (incl. encryption/sync at DB-5/DB-2) in the post-validation hardening pass. |
| Toolkit scan-cascade audit + 6 command migrations | toolkit-development | parked — filed in ~/dev-toolkit/.claude/tasks/ |
| Integrate /task-new ↔ native task panel | toolkit-development | parked — sync gap found 2026-06-08 |
| Global Calendar (cross-module read-only aggregator over `dueIn`) | (feature) | parked platform surface — build when its feeder modules are built |

## ✅ Completed (last 30 days)

| Task | Completed | Sessions |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **linear-projectize** (U3 — re-scoped LIF-61…95 onto the roadmap M1→M4: created M1.0/M1.4/M2/M3/M4 Projects, moved 33 existing issues to final homes, created split/head issues LIF-98…101, old ①–⑤ emptied; LIF-97 Done) | 2026-07-26 | 1 (2026-07-25→26) |
| **build-roadmap-resequence** (→ foundation-realignment campaign: P1 docs realignment + P2 repo structure [ADR-018] + P3 roadmap resequence [ADR-019]; all exit gates accepted; docs+structure+roadmap coherent, derived from ADRs 001–019; LIF-96 Done) | 2026-07-25 | many (2026-07-23 → 07-25) |
| **storage-master-plan** (ADR-016 + storage-build-plan master ledger; both gates; commit 58dc813) | 2026-07-22 | 1 (2026-07-22) |
| **db-1-schema-primitives** (LIF-61 · P0 storage-rebuild primitives; both gates + review battery + 4 consistency passes) | 2026-07-22 | 1 (2026-07-20→22) |
| **build-roadmap** | 2026-07-20 | 3 (2026-07-20) |
