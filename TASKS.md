## ⚡ In Progress

| Task | Profile | Created | Updated | Status |
|------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| build-roadmap-resequence (→ **foundation-realignment master campaign**; roadmap resequence = Part 3) | Project Foundation Setup | 2026-07-23 | 2026-07-25 | **✅ PART 1 COMPLETE — EXIT GATE ACCEPTED (2026-07-25).** Parts 0 + 1.0–1.4 done. The exit gate (quality-gate-foundation + 6 independent adversarial critics over the whole corpus) returned REVISE → the `preferences` blocker (mis-triaged "aligned", never re-run; missing E9/N6/N7 + ADR-014 Layer-3) was fixed via a LITE-gated Tier-2 re-run (plan SHIP + post-impl SHIP), plus knowledge SP1 fill + gamification PII reconcile + cosmetics. **34/34 docs aligned, corpus-wide zero forward-stale, cross-consistency AGREE.** No `/adr-new` owed (preferences received existing ADR decisions). **NEXT = Part 2 (repository structure from the realigned docs — forward-declared, earns its own gate-1; likely ADR-018)** → Part 3 (roadmap resequence). |

## 🧭 Next session

**✅ PART 1 COMPLETE — EXIT GATE ACCEPTED (2026-07-25). NEXT = Part 2 (repository structure).**
Documentation realignment is done and accepted: 34/34 docs aligned, corpus-wide zero forward-stale, cross-consistency AGREE.

**FIRST ACTION next session — Part 2.0 planning (its own gate-1):**
Part 2 is FORWARD-DECLARED, not yet detailed — it earns its own gate-1 plan before execution (per the master-plan
umbrella framing). Derive the target repo structure from the now-realigned docs: package boundaries; `core/src` homes
for the 5 substrates (sessions/spaces/capability/measurability/economy); `schema/` organization; a disposition ledger
(keep/migrate/quarantine/delete) for every censused file/dir; execute the reorg (quarantine legacy → `Old/_legacy`,
stand up the correctly-shaped skeleton, unwire the v1 `schema.ts` monolith). **Structure only — no feature code.**
Likely **ADR-018** (retire Phase-0 architecture; re-derive from docs). Full double-gate per unit + exit gate.

**The Part-1/Part-2 boundary is now LIVE:** Part 1 deliberately deferred every code/directory-home call
(`[DEFERRED — Part 2]`) — Part 2 is where those homes get decided. The realigned docs cite conceptual owners (ADRs);
Part 2 places them.

**Read first on resume:** `realignment-master-plan/_index.md` (Part-2 forward-declaration + the umbrella framing)
+ the `current-state-baseline/baseline.md` (the file census Part 2's disposition ledger works from) + `ADR-016`
(storage rebuild — the `schema.ts` monolith unwire) + `ADR-017` (features-first, what Part 3 sequences).

**Deferred open Qs (still open):** "RP" abbreviation (Part 3.0, non-blocking); V1/ADR-007 saved-views dedicated
reframe pass; the noted gamification stale-half-line was fixed this session (no longer open).

**Reusable patterns locked across the campaign** (full per-unit detail in the session-log; kept here as the Part-2 toolkit):
- **Per-unit LITE loop:** ground → read ALL 5 aspects to refine the sweep's single-aspect verdict → **grep the live schema floor FIRST** → persist a PLAN → independent adversarial critique → fix → approve → implement → grep-verify.
- **Two critiques for big work:** a PLAN critique (can't catch execution drift) AND a POST-IMPLEMENTATION critique on the prose (catches stale mechanisms surviving as ordinary English).
- **R6 has two shapes:** recovered-domain (no As-is floor, e.g. health/core) vs live-schema (real floor → two-tier retire, e.g. habits/projects/finance) — grep the schema to tell which.
- **Substrate reframes:** X*/AI* ingest layering · M1/M2 measured framing · S1 sessions reframe · E9 god-table split · pure-gap net-new token-naming.
- **The gate's own lesson (this session):** a sweep "aligned/gap" label scores the *token surface* — a context that is *silent* (names no retired token) can still fail applicable predicates ("aligned by omission"). The whole-corpus exit gate + sibling-doc cross-check is what catches it. Check verdicts against *applicability* (framework §4), not just anti-signal presence.

## 📋 Planned

| Task | Profile | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Storage rebuild — from zero** (v1 schema ~60% stale → author v2 from scratch; `ADR-016` + `storage-build-plan.md` ledger + per-table gating. DB-1/LIF-61 ✅ done.) | Generic Coding Session | ⏸ **PARKED by ADR-017** — sequencing inverted to features-first; schema now authored per-feature, not full-schema-first. Resurfaces (incl. encryption/sync at DB-5/DB-2) in the post-validation hardening pass. |
| Toolkit scan-cascade audit + 6 command migrations | toolkit-development | parked — filed in ~/dev-toolkit/.claude/tasks/ |
| Integrate /task-new ↔ native task panel | toolkit-development | parked — sync gap found 2026-06-08 |
| Global Calendar (cross-module read-only aggregator over `dueIn`) | (feature) | parked platform surface — build when its feeder modules are built |

## ✅ Completed (last 30 days)

| Task | Completed | Sessions |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **storage-master-plan** (ADR-016 + storage-build-plan master ledger; both gates; commit 58dc813) | 2026-07-22 | 1 (2026-07-22) |
| **db-1-schema-primitives** (LIF-61 · P0 storage-rebuild primitives; both gates + review battery + 4 consistency passes) | 2026-07-22 | 1 (2026-07-20→22) |
| **build-roadmap** | 2026-07-20 | 3 (2026-07-20) |
| **documentation-blueprint** | 2026-07-19 | ~20+ (2026-06-08 → 07-19) |
| toolkit-setup | 2026-06-08 | 2 |
