| ar-2-database-adapter-web (LIF-73, Boot & DB spine) | Add Backend Component | 2026-07-27 | 2026-07-27 | in-progress — **both plan gates done; banked before Approval 2 → implement next** |

## 🧭 Next session

**RESUME AR-2 IMPLEMENTATION (LIF-73 · critical-path root of M1.0).** Both planning gates are done and banked:
- Profile: **Add Backend Component** (Default). Task: `.claude/tasks/ar-2-database-adapter-web.md`.
- **READ FIRST:** `docs/specs/components/ar-2-database-adapter-web/sessions/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN-2026-07-27-*.md`
  (Rev 2 — the build prompt, steps C1–C8) + the PLAN (Approval 1 ✅ recorded there) + the task's Decisions table.
- **FIRST ACTION:** get **Approval 2** (optionally re-critique IMPL-PLAN Rev 2 first for extra assurance on the C6
  risk), then implement **C1→C8 in order**. Hard checkpoint after C1/C2: `pnpm --filter @vida/core typecheck`
  green with `repository.ts` UNEDITED (proves the sync-fence).
- **Key locked decisions:** sync driver + Web Worker (`AccessHandlePoolVFS`); `DrizzleDb` stays `'sync'`;
  `repository.ts` untouched (DB-6); optional `sqlCipher` seam; custom Drizzle sync session (`sql-js` blueprint,
  local `mapResultRow`); "async Drizzle proxy" is a roadmap phrase, NOT adopted.
- **C6 is the one real risk:** custom Drizzle sync session over `sqlite-core` internals — `[VERIFY]`-first against
  installed `drizzle-orm@0.45.1` `.d.ts`; fallback = escalate (reopen async fork), don't silently flip.
- **Uncommitted on main:** the AR-2 planning docs + task/session/index files (this session's work) are UNCOMMITTED
  — commit them with (or before) the AR-2 code, or on request.

**PARKED — DS-1 token pipeline** (branch `ds-1-token-pipeline` @ fd9f144): complete + green but out of sequence
(M1.0-b, not the -a critical path); LIF-81 → Backlog. Resumes when the -b wave's turn comes. (This session built
DS-1 first, then course-corrected to the -a spine head AR-2 per the milestone order.)

**Linear hygiene done:** LIF-72 (ar-1) + LIF-61 (db-1) → Done (were lagging Backlog). LIF-73 (ar-2) → In Progress.

<details><summary>✅ FOUNDATION-REALIGNMENT CAMPAIGN COMPLETE (2026-07-25) — prior context</summary>

Part 1 (docs realignment, 34/34 aligned) + Part 2 (repo structure, ADR-018) + Part 3 (roadmap resequence, ADR-019)
done; docs + structure + roadmap coherent (ADRs 001–019). Linear mirrors M1→M4 (M1.0 = 30 issues). M1.0 build is
now underway (AR-2 above).</details>

**Standing follow-ons (create-at-gate, not tasks yet):** net-new module/integration/venue Linear issues are created as
each M-phase begins. **Manual:** archive the 5 empty ①–⑤ Linear Projects in the Linear UI (tracker can't delete Projects).

**Git:** `main` is ~60 commits ahead of `origin/main` — unpushed (push on request).

**FIRST ACTION next session — Part 2.0 planning (its own gate-1):**
Part 2 is FORWARD-DECLARED, not yet detailed — it earns its own gate-1 plan before execution (per the master-plan
umbrella framing). Derive the target repo structure from the now-realigned docs: package boundaries; `core/src` homes
for the 5 substrates (sessions/spaces/capability/measurability/economy); `schema/` organization; a disposition ledger
(keep/migrate/quarantine/delete) for every censused file/dir; execute the reorg (quarantine legacy → `Old/_legacy`,
stand up the correctly-shaped skeleton, unwire the v1 `schema.ts` monolith). **Structure only — no feature code.**
Likely **ADR-018** (retire Phase-0 architecture; re-derive from docs). Full double-gate per unit + exit gate.

**The Part-1/Part-2 boundary is now LIVE:** Part 1 deliberately deferred every code/directory-home call
(`[DEFERRED — Part 2]`) — Part 2 is where those homes get decided. The realigned docs cite conceptual owners (ADRs);
Part 2 places them.

**Read first on resume:** `realignment-master-plan/_index.md` (Part-2 forward-declaration + the umbrella framing)
+ the `current-state-baseline/baseline.md` (the file census Part 2's disposition ledger works from) + `ADR-016`
(storage rebuild — the `schema.ts` monolith unwire) + `ADR-017` (features-first, what Part 3 sequences).

**Deferred open Qs (still open):** "RP" abbreviation (Part 3.0, non-blocking); V1/ADR-007 saved-views dedicated
reframe pass; the noted gamification stale-half-line was fixed this session (no longer open).

**Reusable patterns locked across the campaign** (full per-unit detail in the session-log; kept here as the Part-2 toolkit):
- **Per-unit LITE loop:** ground → read ALL 5 aspects to refine the sweep's single-aspect verdict → **grep the live schema floor FIRST** → persist a PLAN → independent adversarial critique → fix → approve → implement → grep-verify.
- **Two critiques for big work:** a PLAN critique (can't catch execution drift) AND a POST-IMPLEMENTATION critique on the prose (catches stale mechanisms surviving as ordinary English).
- **R6 has two shapes:** recovered-domain (no As-is floor, e.g. health/core) vs live-schema (real floor → two-tier retire, e.g. habits/projects/finance) — grep the schema to tell which.
- **Substrate reframes:** X*/AI* ingest layering · M1/M2 measured framing · S1 sessions reframe · E9 god-table split · pure-gap net-new token-naming.
- **The gate's own lesson (this session):** a sweep "aligned/gap" label scores the *token surface* — a context that is *silent* (names no retired token) can still fail applicable predicates ("aligned by omission"). The whole-corpus exit gate + sibling-doc cross-check is what catches it. Check verdicts against *applicability* (framework §4), not just anti-signal presence.

## 📋 Planned

| Task | Profile | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Storage rebuild — from zero** (v1 schema ~60% stale → author v2 from scratch; `ADR-016` + `storage-build-plan.md` ledger + per-table gating. DB-1/LIF-61 ✅ done.) | Generic Coding Session | ⏸ **PARKED by ADR-017** — sequencing inverted to features-first; schema now authored per-feature, not full-schema-first. Resurfaces (incl. encryption/sync at DB-5/DB-2) in the post-validation hardening pass. |
| Toolkit scan-cascade audit + 6 command migrations | toolkit-development | parked — filed in ~/dev-toolkit/.claude/tasks/ |
| Integrate /task-new ↔ native task panel | toolkit-development | parked — sync gap found 2026-06-08 |
| Global Calendar (cross-module read-only aggregator over `dueIn`) | (feature) | parked platform surface — build when its feeder modules are built |
